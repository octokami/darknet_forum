        "# Text Analysis on forums form the Darkweb and surface web\n",
        "To investigate the differences between forums from the DarkWeb and the surface web, we perform the following analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Sentiment Analysis: to determine the overall sentiment expressed by users. Comparing sentiment scores between the dark web and surface web can reveal differences in the emotional profile prevalent in each environment. Analyzing sentiment patterns can help in identifying forums with a more negative, secretive, or illicit sentiment, which is typically associated with darknet platforms.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Linguistic Analysis: analysing the language used to identify specific linguistic patterns, vocabulary, and expressions unique to each environment. This can help understanding differences in communication styles, jargon, abbreviations or slang used on the dark web versus the surface web.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Named Entity Recognition (NER): to extract named entities such as person names, organizations, locations, or specific terms related to illicit activities. By comparing the frequency and context of these entities between the dark web and surface web, it could be possible to gain insights into the types of content and discussions prevalent in each environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Topic Modeling: we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify the main themes or topics discussed in both dark web and surface web forums. By comparing the distribution of topics between the two environments, it could be possible to assess the variations in the types of discussions taking place.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Other possible analysis for future work:\n",
        "  - Language Style and Stylometry: investigating the writing style and patterns within forum posts to identify unique linguistic characteristics or stylometric features. By comparing these features between the dark web and surface web, it could be possible to uncover variations in writing styles, vocabulary, or even identify potentially overlapping or connected communities.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Network Analysis: performing network analysis on the interactions between forum users, such as co-occurrence analysis, to identify influential users or communities. Contrasting the network structures on the dark web and surface web can reveal differences in the social dynamics and organizational structures within these communities."

Two different approaches were tested: post per post analysis and for a whole topic. No content was flagged any of the moderated categories: \"hate\", \"hate/threatening\", \"self-harm\", \"sexual\", \"sexual/minors\", \"violence\", \"violence/graphic\". Scores were very similarly low across the whole dataset. The documentation of the API explicits that it looks for \"hateful, harassing, or violent content that:\n",
        "  - expresses, incites, or promotes hate based on identity\n",
        "  - intends to harass, threaten, or bully an individual\n",

In special the highest score for hate, albeit barely higher than other samples, was for the post \"Remember to keep killing <group of people, redacted>. They are afraid, and they know that they don't have any future.\". The example does indeed show hate, but even the second in this category and other categories do not present high scores according to the API.\n",

        "As both these test did not seem promissing, they were not performed for the other datasets. The motivation was that the API has a limit of 60 requests per minute, making it a very slow process and not worth the results."
