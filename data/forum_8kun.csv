19,Genshin Impact,16954755,bac8d5,16954754,The character and weapon levels are locked behind account levels because thats how the progression works. You get to a certain account level and it raises your world tier and makes all the enemies in the world tougher and drop better loot. If you're finding all the enemies too easy you're probably just close to having your world tier go up thats all.I do agree about the typical gacha power creep where new characters they introduce will probably end up outclassing the old ones to keep the whales wallets empty but this is a PVE game so theres hardly a good reason to feel constrained to a meta.,

All 21 slides are in Japanese but I have machine translated them to english.<Slide 1 (title slide)Political Correctness and Points to Consider in Creating Advertising Materials <Slide 2Political Correctness, as the Capcom brand is becoming more and more well-known overseas. Using politically and socially fair and neutral words and phrases is growing rapidly in importance.We are required to be conscious of using fair and equitable language and terms that do not include social discrimination or prejudice due to appearance, occupation, gender, culture, race, ethnicity, faith, ideology, health/disability, age, marital status or LGBT.The most recent example is the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement (a global demonstration against police brutality against African Americans).In addition, the number of areas and PR/advertising materials (trailers and art) that need to be created with caution in each region and in the production of PR/advertising materials (trailers and art) is increasing, so the guidelines will be mielized again.In particular, the number of players with diverse backgrounds, tastes and sensitivities is increasing as our titles have grown in sales globally.More attention is needed.Food x religious taboos (be careful of Arabic localization)Foods that Muslims (i.e., Muslims) avoid that require special attention: ""pork,"" ""alcohol,"" ""blood,"" and ""meat that has not been properly processed religiously.Reminder that paid shills were pushing the marketing ploy of ""Crapcom's redemption arc"" in order to make people go back to giving money to the company, pretending that they would do better.Now you can see the results of supporting a shitty company such as Crapcom.All companies are evil.Note: Crapcom wants to pander to mudlsimes AND LGBT abominations at the same time. It would be fun to point that out to mudslime customers, to incite them to riot against Crapcom.",['https://ragnarleaks.top/?068vV05uS2GCgqaWhat']

You will have much better results if you try to make your search requests as specific as possible. Instead of ""how to make a Doom clone"" for example, try ""how to make an engine that renders using binary space partitioning"" because that's the tech that Doom uses. You are more likely to get a blog from someone who actually knows what the fuck they are doing and decided to record their journey as they successfully made the thing you're trying to make.Don't believe the people who tell you Unity is a ""shit engine,"" by the way. There are a lot of shitty and lazy games made in Unity, but that is because of its successful marketing, similar to GameMaker back in the day.

As far as script, I've made a whole ton of progress on that front- about 70% done to be precise.Lately however, I've been meditating on just what kind of game I'd want to make. I've realized that the Uncommon time Project I've been making is exactly what I want to make. The problem is, I've been getting into Godot, and part of me wants to use parts of the story and go on my own path with it.I really don't know what to do, /agdg/. RPGmakerVXAce is nice, but it has the problem I have with most of the entry-level game engines: accessible with some things, but completely asinine if you want to do anything more advanced. The thing is, I'm still learning how to use Godot. I have plenty of programming experience, except that It's frustrating trying to relearn how to program in GDscript. The last time I did game programming was flixel with Actionscript 3, that was years ago.It wouldn't be too hard for more to reimagine the characters, the setting and the world for what I've made for my Uncommon Time project, the problem is, I would have to redo all the busywork-related assets by scratch. If I do this, I would be able to actually sell the game for money, and not be bound by the requirements of Uncommon Time as an IP.The flip-side, with just using RPGmaker and hacking my way through with it. I could actually get this project done. I wouldn't make any money with it, and FP could have a reason to get pissed at me, but it would be an actually-done game.

It's going to have five missions in total with 10 levels each. There is perma-death in the missions so if you die in a mission you get sent back to level 1 of that mission. but once you beat a mission you can go back to it whenever you want. This will allow me to make harder levels overall since due to engine limitations the levels have to be very small in space. Yesterday I already completed all the game over screens, main menu and load screens. I don't know if i want to change the main character or not. Right now I am using the same sprites as the first game in the series and they are meh at best. I would like to add more style to the game. So the MC sprite would be more like how it is done in hotline miami where there is two sprites for the MC (legs and main body) this would allow me to add more detail more easily to the MC. This might be annoying and I might copy some of hotline miamis sprites to figure how to make it look good enough to use. Since the MC has a gun that penetrates multiple enemies I want to have it so it shows how many enemies killed with one bullet. So if a bullet kills 4 enemies at once it doesn't have an animation for the first kill but for each kill afterwards it shows 2x then 3x then 4x and once the bullet hits a wall it makes a sound effect for how many kills it got. This would be a bit easy to implement since I just need to make an individual score for each bullet.Once these two things are done and implemented then I can focus on other shit.",

Using politically and socially fair and neutral words and phrases is growing rapidly in importance.We are required to be conscious of using fair and equitable language and terms that do not include social discrimination or prejudice due to appearance, occupation, gender, culture, race, ethnicity, faith, ideology, health/disability, age, marital status or LGBT.The most recent example is the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement (a global demonstration against police brutality against African Americans).In addition, the number of areas and PR/advertising materials (trailers and art) that need to be created with caution in each region and in the production of PR/advertising materials (trailers and art) is increasing, so the guidelines will be mielized again.In particular, the number of players with diverse backgrounds, tastes and sensitivities is increasing as our titles have grown in sales globally.More attention is needed.Food x religious taboos (be careful of Arabic localization)Foods that Muslims (i.e., Muslims) avoid that require special attention: ""pork,"" ""alcohol,"" ""blood,"" and ""meat that has not been properly processed religiously.Reminder that paid shills were pushing the marketing ploy of ""Crapcom's redemption arc"" in order to make people go back to giving money to the company, pretending that they would do better.Now you can see the results of supporting a shitty company such as Crapcom.All companies are evil.Note: Crapcom wants to pander to mudlsimes AND LGBT abominations at the same time.
